## Questions/comments

- Do I need to abide by CMS standards and formatting (e.g., British/Americanised words, using upright letters for quarks instead of in math mode)? If so, will need to include the ptdr-definitions.sty file from lab book folder
- What should the title of the thesis be? "Dark matter searches at CMS at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV" sounds a bit boring and generic. And should there be a subtitle?
- Can I use different colours for links (from hyperref package), e.g., urls, in Table of Contents, etc.? Or should it all be black/more muted colours?
- Use hyperlinking in this README for the different sections as I add to it
