\chapter{The LHC and the CMS experiment}
\label{chap:detector}

\initial{T}his is the detector chapter.

%=======
\begin{easylist}[itemize]
\ListProperties(Style*=-- , FinalMark={)}, Margin=0.5cm)
& Explain \acrshort{cern} and the \acrshort{lhc} in more detail.
& Give an overview of the \acrshort{cms} experiment and detector (including all subsystems, object identification, algorithms for event/object reconstruction like Particle Flow and \gls{antikt}, and algorithms for tagging objects like \glspl{bjet}).
& Either as a subsection in this chapter or in a separate chapter, discuss the Level-1 Trigger in depth. Emphasise the jet and energy sum triggers as I've worked on them, and Calorimeter Layer-2 for the same reason.
