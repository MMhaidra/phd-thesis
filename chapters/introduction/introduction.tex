% Hard to describe dark matter as an object. Do I call it a 'substance', 'thing', 'mass'? Can refer to it as 'non-luminous' if struggling for other adjectives

\initial{T}he universe, in all its vastness, structure, natural laws and chaos, is comprised of only three principal components: visible matter, the ingredients of stars, planets and life, is the only one we interact with on a regular basis; dark energy, a force or manifestation of something even more mysterious, responsible for the accelerating expansion of the universe, is almost entirely unknown; and dark matter, a substance invisible in all sense of the word, that binds galaxy together and influences large scale structure in the cosmos, is the topic of this thesis.

& Discuss dark matter: motivation, evidence for its existence (and why it can't be neutrinos/dead stars/interstellar debris, etc.), detection methods and how we can probe it at the LHC (production). Should most of this stuff go in the introduction instead?
& Briefly outline particle accelerators and their function, the fact that we can use them to potentially discover dark matter or infer more of its properties, and the models that will be discussed in more detail to try and achieve this outcome.
& The introduction probably doesn't need to be too long, maybe only a few pages. Compare length with other people's theses (ask Ben Krikler for a copy of his, look at Alex's and Lana's).
