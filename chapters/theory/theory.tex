& Give an overview of the fundamental forces and particles.
& Discuss the Standard Model in detail, emphasising certain aspects as they relate to dark matter and the Higgs field (and boson).
& Discuss the theory behind combined Higgs to inv.: only \acrshort{sm} process in which Higgs decays invisibly is $H \rightarrow ZZ \rightarrow 4\nu$ with branching ratio of 0.1\,\% \cite{Heinemeyer:1559921}, whilst the current observed experimental limit is 19\,\% from CMS \cite{Sirunyan:2018owy} and 26\,\% from \acrshort{atlas} \cite{Aaboud:2019rtt}. If new, invisible particles couple to Higgs, branching ratio will be enhanced.
& Discuss the theory behind the semi-visible jets analysis (main sources from Refs. \cite{Cohen:2015toa}, \cite{Cohen:2017pzm}): strongly interacting dark sector in Hidden Valley scenario with a portal to the visible sector. Mentioning dark quarks, dark confinement scale, dark hadronisation and decay, running coupling, etc.
& Explain some of the phenomenological/experimental event characteristics that overlap with both analyses, i.e., what a jet is, and maybe energy sums like \ptmiss, \HT, \htmiss, etc.
